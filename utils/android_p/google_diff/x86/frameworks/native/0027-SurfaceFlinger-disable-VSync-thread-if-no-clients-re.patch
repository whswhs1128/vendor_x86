Subject: [PATCH 27/28] SurfaceFlinger: disable VSync thread if no clients
 requiring.

In EventThread, 2 VSYNCs are needed to do composition and update
the client status. So, a 30FPS video may leads to 60FPS VSYNC,
which means the DispSync thread would be waked 60FPS. This is a
unexpected behavior which takes more power consumption. Now we
update the SF status soon after the first VSYNC, which means no
extra VSYNC needed, and the DispSync could be awaked as expected,
and consequently power get saved.
